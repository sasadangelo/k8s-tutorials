# Kubernetes Tutorials

This is a set of tutorials I created to play wth a Kubernetes cluster.

The following is the list of tutorials.

## 1) Hello K8s

In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a simple "Hello World!" Kubernetes application. We will create a container with a Web Server (Nginx) listening on port 80. The application will be accessible via NodePort Service on 3xxxx port. When the container will be up and running we can connect to it via browser and the "Hello World!" message will appear in it.

To run a demo of the tutorial read the instructions [here](https://github.com/sasadangelo/k8s-tutorials/tree/master/hello-k8s).
